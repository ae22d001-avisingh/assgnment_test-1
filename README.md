# INTRODUCTION TO CFD(AS5420)
## CODING ASSIGNMENT 1(DEADLINE: 15-02-2026, 11:59 PM)

### DESCRIPTION

Write a program which generates the first _n_ numbers in the __Fibonacci Sequence__ where _n_ is the input from the user.

Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each element is the sum of the two elements that precede it. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers.

General expression for Fibonacci sequence is given as:
> F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>

The first 2 numbers of the sequence are 0 and 1. 

### Procedure of writing code

The C++ and python files(main.cpp and main.py) are attached in the test. Students can pick and choose their preferred programming language and code. Some instructions and guidelines are written in the code files and students are requested to follow those instructions and guidelines properly. 

### Testing the code
Use the following code in the terminal window for compiling and executing C++ code:
```
g++ main.cpp -o run
./run
```
Use the following code in the terminal window for compiling and executing python code:
```
python main.py
```

### SAMPLE OUTPUT

Test 1: n=5

Output: 0  1  1  2  3

Test 2: n=10

Output: 0  1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34
