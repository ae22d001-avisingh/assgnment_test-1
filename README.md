## CODING ASSIGNMENT 1(DEADLINE: 15-02-2026, 11:59 PM)

### DESCRIPTION

Write a program which generates the first _n_ numbers in the __Fibonacci Sequence__ where _n_ is the input from the user.

Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each element is the sum of the two elements that precede it. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers.

General expression for Fibonacci sequence is given as:
> F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>

The first 2 numbers of the sequence are 0 and 1. 

### Procedure of writing code
